Installation notes for DKLang Localization Package
==============================================================================
written 2013.12.06 (XE5) - bjm

There are two packages to install:
  * dklang.dpk - runtime package 
  * dcldklang.dpk - design time package
  
The runtime package contains the code necessary for your application.
The design package installs the language controller component, and some 
  utilities into the IDE.
   
To update for new versions of Delphi:
  * edit "LibSuffix.inc" to add the new Delphi version
  * edit "build_all.bat" to reflect the correct registry key and value for 
      the new packages
 
==============================================================================
Installing the packages
==============================================================================
  * Go to the "Packages" foler.

  * View and maybe edit two files to reflect the version of Delphi you are
      installing to:
    * LibSuffix.inc
    * build_all.bat
  
  * Run "build_all.bat". 
  * Set the library path to the DKLang "Src" folder (see below).

*** OR ***

Load and install the packages manually.
    
The packages need to be installed in the correct order because the design time 
  package depends on the runtime package. The runtime package is the only one 
  that needs to be built multiple times to support multiple platforms. The 
  design time package only needs to be built for the IDE platform (win32).
  
  * load dklang.dpk and dcldklang.dpk into the IDE
  * edit LibSuffix.inc to reflect the version of Delphi you are installing to.
  * make sure that we can compile for each platform without overwriting the 
      other platform's output files:
    for each package do:
      under Project|Options :
        Delphi Compiler
          Choose "Target" of "All configurations"
          Set "Unit output directory" to "$(Platform)\$(Config)\"
  
  * build the runtime package for each platform 
    for dklang.dpk:
      Add new platforms (select "Target Platforms" in the outline and right 
        click to "Add Platform...") for each platform you want to enable 
        dklang for.
      for each platform do "Build" (right click on project outline to"Build")

  * build the design time package
    for dcldklang.dpk:
      The design time is only win32 because the IDE is still only win32, so 
        we do not need to add any new platforms.
      do "Build" (right click on project outline to"Build")

==============================================================================
Setting library paths
==============================================================================
Your code will need to be able to find dklang.pas. This can be done either by
  adding library paths to the IDE or you can add dklang.pas to each of your
  projects that use DKLang.
  
To add a library path to dklang.pas for each platform:
  under Tools|Options :
    Environment Options|Delphi Options|Library
    for each platform:
      change "Selected Platform" to the platform
      add the path to dklang.pas to "Library path"
