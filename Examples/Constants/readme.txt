This is a bit more advanced example on DKLang Package usage.

When you click the 'Test' button, a message box is displayed, with the text
taken from a constant. You can edit the project constants ONLY by using
Project | Edit project constants... menu item. Don't edit the .dklang file
directly as its contents is generated and updated automatically!
