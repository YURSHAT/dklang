<h1>Release notes: DKLang version 3.0</h1>
<div class=pagebody>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>This is a major update to the package.

<p>The main novelty is complete Unicode support at design level, so package handles all language data as Unicode strings
  (WideString). This resulted in Unicode .dklang (and .lng) files being created and loaded.

<p>You are strongly recommended to upgrade your
  <a href="http://www.dk-soft.org/redir.php?product=dktraned&action=viewinfo" target=_blank>DKLang Translation
  Editor</a> to version 3.0 as well. This is also because of Unicode support.

<p>The problem with constant editor in Delphi 2005+ is resolved by using a separate resource file. This requires
  converting your old project using constants. So, <u>if you were using DKLang version 2.x, please carefully read</u>
  <a href="main-upgrading.html">Upgrading from previous versions</a> prior to installing. 

<p>Version 3.0 introduces support for Delphi 2006, but it isn't tested yet (simply because I don't have it). I believe
  it should be okay though.

<p>Further details you can find in <a href="main-revision-history.html">Revision History</a> section.

<p>P.&nbsp;S. I would be thankful if you send me translations for my <a href="main-supplied-examples.html">examples</a>
  in your native language (Unicode files only please).
