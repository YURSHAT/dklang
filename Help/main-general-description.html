<p><b>DKLang Localization Package</b> is a set of classes intended to simplify localization of applications written in
  Delphi.

<p>What are the benefits of DKLang compared to Borland's ITE (Integrated Translation Environment)?

<ul>
  <li>First, DKLang is completely <b>free</b>.  Moreover, DKLang is open-source so you always can see 'how the wind blows'.
  <li>Second, DKLang is very lightweight and runtime-optimized. You always get predictable results as the implemented
      technology is obvious and transparent.
  <li>Third, DKLang allows transparent language switching at any time while ITE relies on a resource DLL with predefined
      extension when loading the program and you cannot change the language further.
  <li>Fourth, Application using DKLang can consist of the only executable which includes any number of languages in its
      resource; it allows you to decide yourself which language should be included 'statically' and which ones are
      linked when program runs. In contrast, ITE always requires that a DLL with predefined extension for each language
      resides in the program directory: this means you should redistribute all the language DLLs with each copy of the
      program.
  <li>Fifth, being open-source, you are free to extend the capabilities of DKLang.  Join the <a href="http://www.dk-soft.org/talk/"
      target="_blank">community</a>.
  <li>And finally, language files are plain-text files so one can edit them with any text editor supporting Unicode. ITE
      uses only compiled resource DLLs prepared with using special Translation Manager.
</ul>
