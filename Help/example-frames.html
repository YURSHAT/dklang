<p>This is a basic example on how you use frames with DKLang Package. The three frames are translated from a single 
  language file section. This is achieved by assigning the SectionName property in the base frame class
  (<b>TfrFontSettings</b>) so all three its descendants (inlined in the main form) also have the same value for 
  <b>SectionName</b>. This way all tree frames are associated with the same translation.

<p>This is only one of four possible methods of translating frames.

<p>The second method would use empty value for SectionName thus causing the section to bear name <b>frFontSettings</b>;
  for the inlined frame to be translated automatically, the frame component should be named the same, ie.
  <b>frFontSettings</b>. Obviously, this allows for having only one instance of a frame on a form.

<p>The third method assumes you turn off autosaving (exclude <b>dklcoAutoSaveLangSource</b> from <b>lcMain.Options</b>)
  in the base frame class, but turning it back on in the inlined descendant frames. This way you can have several frame
  instances on a form, but each frame is translated separately. Do not forget to exclude frame properties from form's
  language controller (inspect this <b>fMain.lcMain.IgnoreList</b> to learn how you do it).

<p>And finally you can have no controller at all in the base frame, but rather serve all the form component hierarchy,
  including inlined frames' components, with the only form's controller. This way you also can have several frame
  instances with each property translated separately.

<p>It's up to you to decide which method is more suitable for your needs; you can use different methods in a project.

<p>Also this example demonstrates project constants usage.
