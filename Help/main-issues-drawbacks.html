<ul>
  <li>The implemented localization mechanism doesn't support VFI (visual form inheritance). It is recommended to put
      language controller onto a final, derived form, and not onto the common ancestor form, since there's no means to
      track the origin of a property value.
  <li>No support for custom-defined properties implemented (ie. ones defined with DefineProperties() method).
      Implementing such a feature would require knowing and analyzing all the form (visual) ancestors, which is a
      somewhat hard task.
  <li>You cannot properly handle the forms open in the IDE as standalone files. DKLang package requires that you have an
      active project open.
  <li>The packages were designed for the following versions of Borland IDE (all with the latest updates applied):
      <ul>
        <li>Delphi 6
        <li>Delphi 7
        <li>BDS 2005
        <li>BDS 2006
      </ul>
      But there's a bug introduced in BDS 2005 (and still persisting in BDS 2006) which makes constant editing in those
      IDEs impossible. The bug makes the <b>IOTAProjectResource</b> interface inaccessible. You can vote for this bug to
      be fixed at <a href="http://qc.borland.com/wc/qcmain.aspx?d=15657" target=_blank>Borland Quality Central</a>.
</ul>
